## UX


### Project Goals

To create a site that allows users to store books they have enjoyed/want to read. To allow the user to add a genre, review and rating
so if they decide to share their book, other users can get inspiration from the books they have added. 

### User Goals

I want to have a place online I can store my favourite books and also get information on other books I have not read. 

### Developer and Business Goals

### User Stories

As a user I want...

*To be able to register quickly without the site taking any unneccesary information.
*To be able to find new books I haven't read before.
*To be able to see the Genre and rating of new books so there is enough information for me to decide whether I would enjoy it. 
*To be able to navigate around the site with ease.
*To be able to edit or delete my added books with ease.
*To know that I am the only person able to edit my books that I have added.
*To know my books will be saved when I log out, so when I revisit the site, my books are still there.


### Design Choices

I have decided to go for a simple, professional design. The demographic of my users are readers that use the internet as a resource to source new books.
This would be a large range of ages and backgrounds. Due to this I have stuck to a very classic look I think is already paired with English Literature.

+ Font
... The font I chose was 'Playfair Display' due to it's 'old timey' design lending itself to the 18th century. 

+ Colour
... I chose Blue as my main colour because it is known as a very calm colour, reading is a peaceful activitie and so should looking into books online. 
...Also there are a lot of colours and patterns on the covers of the books. I want the books to stand out and be the main feature on the page, therefore
...light blue background worked very well as it brings any elements to the foreground. 
...I chose a dark blue colour for the nav bar and the buttons. These are all points of contact for the user and I wanted them to stand out without
...contrasting with the rest of the sit. 

+ Styling
...I used the Materialize framework which kept the site clean and simple.
...I decided not to curve off any edges on photos/cards, I want the site to have the resemblence of book corners throughout and the book images, 
to stay looking like books.

###Bugs during developement

1. The columns the cards from Materialize were in, were not centering inside their row.
*Solution: Add a flexbox class to the column you need to center. Add custom styles to center.
